    API
        [ ] create a user with password etc
        [ ] store device tokens associated with user
        [ ] custom mime-type

Selling points
==============

By sharing all locations to all brewers: you can see where else you might want to stock

Potential for promotions (good ad space for Regulars ;)

Alerts for new stock (advertising angle)



Ideas / Later
=============

Two icons, one for market, other for bar (needs distinction in database)
Clients can vote for new locations
Search on type of beer (requires beer list and classifications)


Map Kit Notes
=============

If GPS accuracy isn't critical and you don't need continuous tracking use the "significant-change" location service.
Doesn't track continuously and only wakes the device when significant changes occur. (500m or more)
