Selling points
==============

By sharing all locations to all brewers: you can see where else you might want to stock

Potential for promotions, alerts for new stock (advertising),



Ideas / Later
=============

Two icons, one for market, other for bar (needs distinction in database)
Clients can vote for new locations
Search on type of beer (requires beer list and classifications)




Web Backend
===========

Lists all locations, powers to edit name, location

NOTE:
If Brewer A creates a location, it will show up for Brewer B.
If Brewer B wants to change the location, he can do so, but it is submitted for everyone else to vote on the change.
Majority wins.



Map Kit Notes
=============

If GPS accuracy isn't critical and you don't need continuous tracking use the "significant-change" location service.
Doesn't track continuously and only wakes the device when significant changes occur. (500m or more)
